# SimpleGameOfLife
A "remake" of Conway's Game of Life with additional rules. Pretty simple to play, because it's just a kind of animation.
### The rules of this Game are:
1. Every cell with less then 2 living 'neighbours' dies.
2. Every cell with more then 3 dies, too.
3. Every cell with 3 or 2 living neighbours stays alive.

### Additional rules:
1. Every cell ages with every day. The cell dies, when it's too old.
2. At day 180 a new year begins and new cells come to "celebrate the new year"
